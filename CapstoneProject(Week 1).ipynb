Then we use \nPython\u2019s geopy package to obtain the latitude and longitude of all the districts present in the dataframe.\nDescription of the data -\nThe output shows the final dataset . The dataset consists of a single Dataframe with 9 columns containing state, districts, latitude and longitudes of the particular district etc. Other columns like code, headquarters, population, area and density have also been scraped from the website which can be used for further analysis.\n",
